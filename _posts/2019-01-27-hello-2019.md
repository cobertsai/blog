Finally, I build my web site by Jekyll. The reason why I create a blog is that many books tell us to write blog in order to recored our dayily life. Also, I see the FB post by [t6847kimo] which introduces the powerful tool for creating personal blog hosted on github -- [jekyllrb]. 

However, as a person who just finished my military service. I was totally forgotten how to program even the logic of programming :( It takes me a morning to build up this blog which can be finised in half an hour if I know the knowledge of all these tools including Ruby, Gem and Github Pages. BTW The theme I chose is [minima]. I have to say that all these tools are so amazing for building a personal blog. Here are some links I found in this build-up-my-blog trip.
